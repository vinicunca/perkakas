# Ignores

List of ignored files and directories.

## Defaults

By default this config will ignore the following files and directories:

<EslintIgnoreList />

<div class="tip custom-block pt-2">

In addition, by default it will also parse your **`.gitignore`** file and include them into the list.

</div>
