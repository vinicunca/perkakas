# Stylistic

List of rules that are related to formatting and styling. For more details please refer to [ESLint Stylistic](https://eslint.style/).

## Base Rules

This config is used due to ESLint and `typescript-eslint` teams [decided to deprecate formatting/stylistic-related rules](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17522) from their core due to the **maintenance cost**.
