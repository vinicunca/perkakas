# sample

Returns a random subset of size `sampleSize` from `array`.

Maintains and infers most of the typing information that could be passed
along to the output. This means that when using tuples, the output will be
a tuple too, and when using literals, those literals would be preserved.

The items in the result are kept in the same order as they are in the input.
If you need to get a shuffled response you can pipe the shuffle function
after this one.

## Data First

```js [light]
P.sample(array, sampleSize);
```

:docs-parameters{ :params='[{"name":"data"},{"name":"sampleSize","description":"the number of elements to take"}]' :returns='{"name":"Object"}' }

```js
P.sample(['hello', 'world'], 1); // => ["hello"] // typed string[]
P.sample(['hello', 'world'] as const, 1); // => ["world"] // typed ["hello" | "world"]
```

## Data Last

```js [light]
P.sample(sampleSize)(array);
```

:docs-parameters{ :params='[{"name":"sampleSize","description":"the number of elements to take"}]' :returns='{"name":"Object"}' }

```js
P.sample(1)(['hello', 'world']); // => ["hello"] // typed string[]
P.sample(1)(['hello', 'world'] as const); // => ["world"] // typed ["hello" | "world"]
```
